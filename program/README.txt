This README explains code snippets programmed in Scratch
    This README will also serve as our 'code' subfolder, we will add links and descriptions
to the README as me progress through the project. We will give a code subfolder with
the Scratch projects, if you want to download them and open them through a Scratch
desktop app, but using the URL's would probably be easier.

!!! INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN CODE !!!

    Scratch code can only be viewed on the Scratch website (https://scratch.mit.edu/)
or a Scratch desktop app. So in this Readme we will give you links to each project. 
Copy and paste the links in your browser URL if you don't wish
to run .bat files, or have a system other than Windows.

    You could also download and run our runCodeSnippets.bat that will open the 
code snippets in separate tabs in your default web browser. Once you are looking
at the program from scratch.mit.edu, you can run it or look at the code by clicking
the "See inside" button in the upper right of the window.
This .bat and instructions serve as our Makefile.

!!! FUNCTIONS !!!
Project Program
==============================================================
=== Snake Game ===============================================
==============================================================

URL : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/386853145/

This is our projects big program. We are attempting to make a 
game of snake in scratch. 


To use the game just click the flag and you whould be presented with the Start Menu.

Clicking the start button will take you to the game.

Press any arrow key and the snake will begin to move.

As you eat fruit the snake will grow and your score will go up.
Watch out! As your score increases, so does the number of bombs 
on the map.

The game ends from you hitting the walls or a bomb.

Known Features??
We have all the bombs respawn at random locations everytime you get a point.
This makes the game more interesting, but there is a chance that a bomb will spawn
on top of the snake. You can crawl over yourself unlik normal snake games, so a 
strategy to try is consolidate your snake into a smaller area as it gets bigger.
