This README explains code snippets Hello World and Right-Left
programmed in Scratch.

!!! INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN CODE !!!

    Scratch code can only be viewed on the Scratch website (https://scratch.mit.edu/)
or a Scratch desktop app. So in this Readme we will give you links to the exposed
code of each project. Copy and paste the links in your browser URL if you don't wish
to run .bat files, or have a system other than Windows.

    You could also download and run our runCodeSnippets.bat that will open both of the 
code snippets in two separte tabs in your default web browser. Once you are looking
at the program from scratch.mit.edu, you can run it or look at the code by clicking
the "See inside" button in the upper right of the window.
This .bat and instructions serve as our Makefile.

!!! FUNCTIONS !!!
==============================================================
=== Hello World ==============================================
==============================================================

URL : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/379337442/

Note the comments mention how we wrote it for this Milestone, proof we aren't 
 just giving a link to somebody elses code.

This Hello World function is as easy as it gets, with two blocks.
 With start the function with "when (flag) clicked", and then cause the
cat sprite to say "Hello World!".

We are learning Scratch is really optimized for graphic response, and not so much
 a console with text output that we see in other languages. The point of a Hello World
function is to familiarize yourself with getting something to respond, and having the 
 cat say Hello World is how we approached it.

===============================================================
=== Right-Left ================================================
===============================================================

URL : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/379338240/

This function Right-Left displays a few different blocks given for us to use.
 When reading the code you can see how Scratch approaches basic iteration, keyboard input,
and sprite movement. 

Even with a function as small as this we begin to see how intuitive the vernacular used to
 label the blocks is. It is kinda strange going backwards, coming from a couple years of coding
experience to a language designed to be a first experience.

The cat says what you should do to use the function, he will walk Right, 
 and then when prompted walk back Left. The function is done after this.
